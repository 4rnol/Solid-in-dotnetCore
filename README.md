Single Responsibility Principle
Each software module should have one and only one reason to change.

Open/Closed Principle
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

Liskov Substitution Principle
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base type.

Interface Segregation Principle
Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractio
